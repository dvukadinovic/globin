Quickstart
==============

After succesffuly installing **globin** and **pyrh**, lets test the installation and run a few examples for forward modelling and for inversion.

Forward modelling
--------------

Navigate to ``tests/forward_modelling`` directory and run ``python run_me.py``. The code will synthesize a spectrum of two Fe I lines at 630.15 nm and 630.25 nm using FAL C atmospheric model with the magnetic field vector of strength 1500 G, inclination of 60 degrees and azimuth of 15 degrees.
