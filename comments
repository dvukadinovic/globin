21/09/2020 - testing the tau scale forward solution in RH

RH can synthesise the spectrum from atmosphere in optical depth scale (given
as logarithm of optical depth). In 'Atmos' folder is given .py script for
converting FAL model atmospheres to MULTI atmospheres with optical depth
scale.

Spectrum difference between computed spectrum in kappa and tau scale are
small. There is small difference in continuum level, but it must be noted that
these models are a bit different (some of them is having larger / smaller
value of electron concentration, let's say).
