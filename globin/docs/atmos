#--- Introduction

We assume that the atmosphere is given as fits file. It has structure
(nx,ny,npar,nz) and is given in MULTI's format: first five parameters are
scale, temperature [K], electron density [m-3], vertical velocity [km/s],
microturbulent velocity [km/s] and last six parameters are Hydrogen 1-6 level
density assuming LTE distribution. Scale of atmosphere is in logairthm of
optical depth (currently only).


#--- Changes to 'globin/atmos.py' file

To do:

-- add in fits file header the order of parameters.
-- add in fits file header the used scale. Options are: logarithm of optical depth 
     (default), mass density or vertical height [km].
-- check run folders for background opacity from previous run. Let the code take
     atomic pops from previous run and then iterate (will speed up calculation).
-- make tools for converting given atmosphere to MULTI's format.
